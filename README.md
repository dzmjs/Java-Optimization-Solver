# Java-Optimization-Solver
This project demonstrates how to solve complex equations in Java using the Apache Commons Math3 library.  

## How to use
 `git clone` to download this project.  
  - Java version: 1.8 
  - Gradle version: 8.5 
## How to verify the solver
 The answer is Excel, we can check out those two answer, then we will find those ansewers are similar to use. 
## File introduction
 - `Demo.xlse` This file for verify the java result.
 - `SolverExample.java` A simple solver.
 - `MultiVariableSolverExample.java` A complex solver for two variables.

## Reminder
 If a mathematical equation has no solution, it has no solution in the field of mathematics, and the code will NOT produce a solution either.   
 In advanced mathematics, there are many approximate solutions that are not exact, but they are sufficient for engineering and can be used.  
 Python is more powerful than Java in mathematical field, if you have learned Python, solve your engineering problem by Python. For example, Wavelet Analysis.
